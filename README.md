# Steel-Slag-Concrete-Datasets
This repository provides a curated dataset for the study of instance segmentation and homogeneity evaluation of aggregates in steel slag concrete. The dataset was developed to support research in intelligent concrete quality inspection, particularly in the context of aggregate composition analysis and slag substitution rate evaluation.
Dataset Description
The dataset includes 1,784 high-resolution images of cut cross-sections of steel slag concrete specimens with varying substitution ratios of natural aggregate by steel slag. Specimens were prepared based on volume replacement of coarse aggregates following the Chinese national standard JGJ 55-2011: Design Code for Ordinary Concrete Mix Proportion, and include the following substitution ratios: 0%, 10%, 20%, ..., up to 100%. Each ratio group contains 20 concrete specimens, resulting in 11 groups in total.

Concrete Mix Design (per mÂ³)
Substitution Rate	Natural Sand	Natural Aggregate	Steel Slag Aggregate	Cement	Water
0%	770.13	1020.87	0.00	435	174
10%	770.13	918.783	102.087	435	174
...	...	...	...	...	...
100%	770.13	0.00	1020.87	435	174

Image Acquisition and Annotation
After standard curing, each concrete specimen was vertically sliced to expose internal aggregate distributions. A custom imaging setup was designed to ensure consistent lighting and high-contrast image capture. The acquired raw images were augmented using cropping, rotation, and salt-and-pepper noise addition.

For semantic segmentation tasks, all images were pixel-wise annotated using the AnyLabeling software. Three classes were labeled: natural aggregate, steel slag aggregate, and pores. Unlabeled or ambiguous regions were marked as background. To improve annotation efficiency and segmentation detail, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) developed by Meta AI was integrated into the annotation process.

A visual comparison between traditional manual annotation and SAM-assisted annotation is shown below:
